## About Me
Hello. I'm Levi Terry, a student at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, Arizona. I am currently studying for a dual Bachelor of Science major in Robotics and Embedded Systems and Digital Maker and Fabrication. A deep passion for Robotics fuels me, and I am always looking for new ways to learn and grow in technology. 

Eager to explore the endless possibilities of technology, I aspire to carve my path towards a career that merges innovation and practicality. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow in the field of technology. When I'm not immersed in the world of tech, you'll likely find me out in nature seeking solace or inspiration in the beauty of the outdoors.
